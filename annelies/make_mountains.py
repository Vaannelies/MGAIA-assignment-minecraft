"""
NOTE: This file is an old example script. Although it is no longer
      comprehensive, and it does not use the most modern features or best
      practices of GDPC, it still contains a good amount of information while
      performing a practical task.

      New users are advised to look at the scripts in tutorials/ first, and
      then come back here for a slightly outdated, but practical application.

Generate an emerald city.

This file contains a collection of functions designed
to introduce new coders to the GDMC HTTP client in Python.

The source code of this module contains examples for:
- How to structure a file neatly (search 'STRUCTURE')
- Requesting the build area (search 'BUILDAREA')
- Introduction to world slices (search 'WORLDSLICE')
- Introduction to basic heightmaps (search 'HEIGHTMAP')
- Introduction to basic geometric shapes (search 'geo')

NOTE: We recommend creating your own files instead of modifying or adding code
      to these pre-existing files.

NOTE: If part of the program is running to fast for you to understand, insert
      >>> from time import sleep
      and
      >>> sleep(0.1)
      at the appropriate locations for a delay of 1/10 of a second
      Alternatively, inserting
      >>> input("Waiting for user to press [Enter]")
      will pause the program at that point.

NOTE: This file will only be updated in the case of breaking changes
      and will not showcase new features!

NOTE: Should you have any questions regarding this software, feel free to visit
      the #â„¹-framework-support channel on the GDMC Discord Server
      (Invite link: https://discord.gg/ueaxuXj)
